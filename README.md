# Water-Level-Controller-and-Soil-Irrigation-System-using-IC-s
This is a hardware project which is done only by using different ICs, sensors, resistors, transistors, etc. It can help in identifying water level and can control it also. For more applications can be used in Soil Irrigation Systems too.

In order to automate particular duties, this project will create two electronic circuits
utilizing various ICs. In the first circuit, a 555 timer IC is used to measure the soil moisture
content and turn on or off the device in accordance with the moisture level. The second
circuit will regulate the fluid level in a tank using a 4093 NAND gate IC, diodes, and a
transistor. When the tank is empty, the circuit will automatically turn off the motor. Both
circuits are easy to build and may be used in a variety of commercial and domestic
applications.
